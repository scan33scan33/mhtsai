Hello! I am Ming-Hen (Henry). I am a applied-mathematician, machine learning researcher and computer hacker. <br>
You are landing on my tutoring page. Since 2006, I have started my teaching career and had many successful stories. <br>
In addition to completing their projects, some of my great students got a job in Google or won medals in International Olympiad in Informatics. <br>
Here, you will see my the services and classes that I offer. Classes are offered in Mandarin Chinese or English over Skype or in person.<br>
If you are curious, <a href="#bio">here is some of my brief bio.</a><br>
<br>
To offer back to our great community, if the students agree, I release my class notes to my <a href="">github</a> or <a href="">Google Drive</a>.
